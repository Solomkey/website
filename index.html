            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week 1 <br> I learned how to save things to my website and log in to AWS. I also made a github account and a google doc for all of my links required to sign in. <br> I also learned how important cooperation is from the challenge. I learned about how the engineering process is similar to the scientific process. <br> I also learned the basics of coding and html.

            8/26/23 - 8/31-23 Week 2 <br> This week I learned about mechanical engineering and how to CAD. I also took a quiz on the engineering process and safety procedures and rules. I learned how to use tinker CAD. <br>and model and design the outline for our ruth goldberg project. For our challenge, we modeled common home appliances, and we had to model it using tinker CAD. I chose a washing machine, <br>and I faced many challenges in trying to make a simple object. We also learned about the in depth details of mechanical engineering, and the different types. <br>Fluid mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, manufacturing, and many other engineering branches were all learned this week.

            9/5/23 - 9/8/23 Week 3 <br> This week we took 2 quizzes. We took a mechanical engineering quiz and and a safety quiz. To study for the mechanical engineering quiz, we did a worksheet <br>reviewing the mechanical engineering slides and writing notes from a video we watched on mechanical engineering. Our tinkercads for our rube goldberg projects were due on Tuesday, so we finished that and turned it in. <br>On Friday, we started to actually build our rube goldberg project, and we finished the beginning ramp for the baseball to roll on.

            9/11/23 - 9/14/23 Week 4 <br> This week we spent the majority of our time building our ruth goldberg project. For our project, we had 3 simple devices. A lever, an inclined plane, and <br>a wheel and axle. The way it worked is the ball rolls onto the lever, which pushes the needle attatched to a car onto a ramp, leading it to pop the balloon. It was challenging converting and building what we modeled in <br>tinkercad to real life. However, over time we found ways to overcome these challenges and pop the balloon successfully.

            9/17/23 - 9/21/23 Week 5 <br> On Monday, we spent the day editing our websites and troubleshooting. On tuesday, we did 2 challenges. One of them was a boat challenge, and I made the misake<br> of adding too little weight. My boat oculd have easily handled more weight, but I was scared of it sinking. The other challenge we did was making a paper E. I got a 6/10, because I forgot to match the total vertical<br> length of the E to the total length of the E on the right. On thursday, we finished the paper E challenge, and learned about computer engineering. We have a test next week, so I need to start preparing soon.

            9/25/23 - 9/28/23 Week 6 <br> This week was all about computer engineering. On monday, we did a worksheet about computer engineering, taking notes from a video and 2 slideshows. Then, on <br>Tuesday, we did a lab dissecting a computer to see its parts. it was very interesting seeing the inside of a computer and seeing what the components can do. On Thursday, we did a computer architecture coloring worksheet,<br> testing our knowledge of computer parts. We also took a computer engineering test. I was kind of unprepared, but luckily we had time to study in class and I ended up with a 12/13. Overall, the hardest part about this week was taking apart and putting back together the computer.

            10/2/23 - 10/5/23 Week 7 <br> This week was all about bioengineering. We built and designed prosthetics to get a grasp of what bioengineers do on a daily basis. I found bioengineering to <br>be pretty interesting. Building and designing prosthetics is a lot harder than it looks when you factor in things like the material that it needs to be made of, how everything needs to work, etc. Making a limb that is <br>multipurpose is a challenge. However, the proesthetic we needed to build only needed to fulfill one task, and that was to pick up a water bottle. For the animal prosthetic, I designed a bat wing.

                10/9/23 - 10/12/23 Week 8 <br> Since this week was shorter, we had less time to do things. On Monday, we learned about aerospace engineering. It was interesting learning about forces like <br>lift, drag, thrust, and weight, and how they affect how something travels. It was a little confusing at first, but once I undestood it I found it very interesting. The videos were also interesting, because I got to see<br> how the things I learned applied to real life. On Thursday, we designed our bottle rockets on tinkercad. Honestly, I think I could improve on my design, but I can't think of anything else to add. Currently, I have a cone on top of the rocket and 4 fins on the sides of the rocket to give it a more aerodynamic shape.

                10/16/23 - 10/19/23 Week 9 <br> This week, we designed, built, and tested our rockets. Our rocket had a design with a cone and 4 fins on the side, so it was a pretty basic design. I saw at <br>least 15 rockets that had the same exact design as ours. However, our rocket went the furthrest out of everyones. This is because we chose to use 85 PSI and use a 1 and 1/8 cups of water. This caused our rocket to go <br>extremely fast and go the furthest. Most of our speed and potential distance was lost, because it started spinning, but we still went the farthest nonetheless. If I could change one thing, I would increase the pressure and the amount of water to make it go farther and faster.

                10/23/23 - 10/27/23 Week 10 <br> This week, we learned about environmental engineering. Me and my partner made a filter out of various materials. Our order for the filter was rocks, pebbles, <br>sand, then cotton balls. Our filter worked fine for the first few minutes, but then it got jammed, and almost no watter was coming out the other end of it. Our water ended up looking clean except for the fact that it<br> was yellow, and there wasn't that much water because our filter was clogged. If I could do it again, I would take apart all the pieces of the filter to see what was causing issues, then clean it and fix it accordingly. I found out that I had no idea that water treatment was this complicated, and I took clean water for granted.

                10/30/23 - 11/3/23 Week 11 <br> This week, we learned about electrical engineering. Honestly, I think this has been the most challenging week of this class. I learned a lot about electrical <br>engineering, but I also learned that I don't understand a lot of it either. I learned the equation V=IR to calculate resistance, voltage, or current. I also learned what resistance, current, and voltage is. However, I <br>still don't really understand how a circuit works. I understand the basic idea, but I can't apply it in tinkercad; I find it very challenging. The hardest was lab two: parallel for me. With the help of my groupmates I completed it, but I still don't fully understand it.

                11/6/23  - 11/8/23 Week 12 <br> This week, we did more electrical engineering. First, we transferred our tinkercads onto actual breadboards to do labs 3 and 4. These labs have been some of the <br>the most fun and most frustrating labs by far. It was super fun building a circuit and having everything work, and it made me want to experiement more on what I could do. Seeing what I learned on paper and applying it<br> and seeing it actually work was very satisfying and fun to me. However, the arduino portion of the lab was frustrating. My code wouldn't change the pattern of the LEDs, and so it was stuck to the same pattern, making me unable to do the lab. I probably spent the almost the entire period trying to figure it out until I gave up, <br>and then found out later that we needed to download an app to make it work.

                11/13/23 - 11/16/23 Week 13 <br> This week we learned about business engineering. Honestly, business engineering isn't something that i'm interested in currently, but maybe I might be interested <br>in it in the future. Business engineering is a hybrid between technology and business administration, so you have to be good with talking to people. I am not good at talking to people at all, so I don't think I <br>would be a good fit for the job. Business engineering also requires you to be good with data, which doesn't interest me at all. I find statistics and data somewhat boring. For our sharktank brainstorming, we didn't really come up with anything. We had a few ideas that were kind of bad, like a license plate flipper and a charger that <br>follows you around.
