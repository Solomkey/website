            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week 1 <br> I learned how to save things to my website and log in to AWS. I also made a github account and a google doc for all of my links required to sign in. <br> I also learned how important cooperation is from the challenge. I learned about how the engineering process is similar to the scientific process. <br> I also learned the basics of coding and html.

            8/26/23 - 8/31-23 Week 2 <br> This week I learned about mechanical engineering and how to CAD. I also took a quiz on the engineering process and safety procedures and rules. I learned how to use tinker CAD. <br>and model and design the outline for our ruth goldberg project. For our challenge, we modeled common home appliances, and we had to model it using tinker CAD. I chose a washing machine, <br>and I faced many challenges in trying to make a simple object. We also learned about the in depth details of mechanical engineering, and the different types. <br>Fluid mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, manufacturing, and many other engineering branches were all learned this week.

            9/5/23 - 9/8/23 Week 3 <br> This week we took 2 quizzes. We took a mechanical engineering quiz and and a safety quiz. To study for the mechanical engineering quiz, we did a worksheet <br>reviewing the mechanical engineering slides and writing notes from a video we watched on mechanical engineering. Our tinkercads for our rube goldberg projects were due on Tuesday, so we finished that and turned it in. <br>On Friday, we started to actually build our rube goldberg project, and we finished the beginning ramp for the baseball to roll on.

            9/11/23 - 9/14/23 Week 4 <br> This week we spent the majority of our time building our ruth goldberg project. For our project, we had 3 simple devices. A lever, an inclined plane, and <br>a wheel and axle. The way it worked is the ball rolls onto the lever, which pushes the needle attatched to a car onto a ramp, leading it to pop the balloon. It was challenging converting and building what we modeled in <br>tinkercad to real life. However, over time we found ways to overcome these challenges and pop the balloon successfully.

            9/17/23 - 9/21/23 Week 5 <br> On Monday, we spent the day editing our websites and troubleshooting. On tuesday, we did 2 challenges. One of them was a boat challenge, and I made the misake<br> of adding too little weight. My boat oculd have easily handled more weight, but I was scared of it sinking. The other challenge we did was making a paper E. I got a 6/10, because I forgot to match the total vertical<br> length of the E to the total length of the E on the right. On thursday, we finished the paper E challenge, and learned about computer engineering. We have a test next week, so I need to start preparing soon.

            9/25/23 - 9/28/23 Week 6 <br> This week was all about computer engineering. On monday, we did a worksheet about computer engineering, taking notes from a video and 2 slideshows. Then, on <br>Tuesday, we did a lab dissecting a computer to see its parts. it was very interesting seeing the inside of a computer and seeing what the components can do. On Thursday, we did a computer architecture coloring worksheet,<br> testing our knowledge of computer parts. We also took a computer engineering test. I was kind of unprepared, but luckily we had time to study in class and I ended up with a 12/13. Overall, the hardest part about this week was taking apart and putting back together the computer.

            10/2/23 - 10/5/23 Week 7 <br> This week was all about bioengineering. We built and designed prosthetics to get a grasp of what bioengineers do on a daily basis. I found bioengineering to <br>be pretty interesting. Building and designing prosthetics is a lot harder than it looks when you factor in things like the material that it needs to be made of, how everything needs to work, etc. Making a limb that is <br>multipurpose is a challenge. However, the proesthetic we needed to build only needed to fulfill one task, and that was to pick up a water bottle. For the animal prosthetic, I designed a bat wing.

                10/9/23 - 10/12/23 Week 8 <br> Since this week was shorter, we had less time to do things. On Monday, we learned about aerospace engineering. It was interesting learning about forces like <br>lift, drag, thrust, and weight, and how they affect how something travels. It was a little confusing at first, but once I undestood it I found it very interesting. The videos were also interesting, because I got to see<br> how the things I learned applied to real life. On Thursday, we designed our bottle rockets on tinkercad. Honestly, I think I could improve on my design, but I can't think of anything else to add. Currently, I have a cone on top of the rocket and 4 fins on the sides of the rocket to give it a more aerodynamic shape.
