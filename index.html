            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week 1 <br> I learned how to save things to my website and log in to AWS. I also made a github account and a google doc for all of my links required to sign in. <br> I also learned how important cooperation is from the challenge. I learned about how the engineering process is similar to the scientific process. <br> I also learned the basics of coding and html.

            8/26/23 - 8/31-23 Week 2 <br> This week I learned about mechanical engineering and how to CAD. I also took a quiz on the engineering process and safety procedures and rules. I learned how to use tinker CAD. <br>and model and design the outline for our ruth goldberg project. For our challenge, we modeled common home appliances, and we had to model it using tinker CAD. I chose a washing machine, <br>and I faced many challenges in trying to make a simple object. We also learned about the in depth details of mechanical engineering, and the different types. <br>Fluid mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, manufacturing, and many other engineering branches were all learned this week.

            9/5/23 - 9/8/23 Week 3 <br> This week we took 2 quizzes. We took a mechanical engineering quiz and and a safety quiz. To study for the mechanical engineering quiz, we did a worksheet <br>reviewing the mechanical engineering slides and writing notes from a video we watched on mechanical engineering. Our tinkercads for our rube goldberg projects were due on Tuesday, so we finished that and turned it in. <br>On Friday, we started to actually build our rube goldberg project, and we finished the beginning ramp for the baseball to roll on.

            9/11/23 - 9/14/23 Week 4 <br> This week we spent the majority of our time building our ruth goldberg project. For our project, we had 3 simple devices. A lever, an inclined plane, and <br>a wheel and axle. The way it worked is the ball rolls onto the lever, which pushes the needle attatched to a car onto a ramp, leading it to pop the balloon. It was challenging converting and building what we modeled in <br>tinkercad to real life. However, over time we found ways to overcome these challenges and pop the balloon successfully.

            9/17/23 - 9/21/23 Week 5 <br> On Monday, we spent the day editing our websites and troubleshooting. On tuesday, we did 2 challenges. One of them was a boat challenge, and I made the misake<br> of adding too little weight. My boat oculd have easily handled more weight, but I was scared of it sinking. The other challenge we did was making a paper E. I got a 6/10, because I forgot to match the total vertical<br> length of the E to the total length of the E on the right. On thursday, we finished the paper E challenge, and learned about computer engineering. We have a test next week, so I need to start preparing soon.

            9/25/23 - 9/28/23 Week 6 <br> This week was all about computer engineering. On monday, we did a worksheet about computer engineering, taking notes from a video and 2 slideshows. Then, on <br>Tuesday, we did a lab dissecting a computer to see its parts. it was very interesting seeing the inside of a computer and seeing what the components can do. On Thursday, we did a computer architecture coloring worksheet,<br> testing our knowledge of computer parts. We also took a computer engineering test.
