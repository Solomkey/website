            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week 1 <br> I learned how to save things to my website and log in to AWS. I also made a github account and a google doc for all of my links required to sign in. <br> I also learned how important cooperation is from the challenge. I learned about how the engineering process is similar to the scientific process. <br> I also learned the basics of coding and html.

            8/26/23 - 8/31-23 Week 2 <br> This week I learned about mechanical engineering and how to CAD. I also took a quiz on the engineering process and safety procedures and rules. I learned how to use tinker CAD. <br>and model and design the outline for our ruth goldberg project. For our challenge, we modeled common home appliances, and we had to model it using tinker CAD. I chose a washing machine, <br>and I faced many challenges in trying to make a simple object. We also learned about the in depth details of mechanical engineering, and the different types. <br>Fluid mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, manufacturing, and many other engineering branches were all learned this week.
