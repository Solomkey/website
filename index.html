            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week 1 <br> I learned how to save things to my website and log in to AWS. I also made a github account and a google doc for all of my links required to sign in. <br> I also learned how important cooperation is from the challenge. I learned about how the engineering process is similar to the scientific process. <br> I also learned the basics of coding and html.

            8/26/23 - 8/31-23 Week 2 <br> This week I learned about mechanical engineering and how to CAD. I also took a quiz on the engineering process and safety procedures and rules. I learned how to use tinker CAD. <br>and model and design the outline for our ruth goldberg project. For our challenge, we modeled common home appliances, and we had to model it using tinker CAD. I chose a washing machine, <br>and I faced many challenges in trying to make a simple object. We also learned about the in depth details of mechanical engineering, and the different types. <br>Fluid mechanics, materials science, thermodynamics, manufacturing, and many other engineering branches were all learned this week.

            9/5/23 - 9/8/23 Week 3 <br> This week we took 2 quizzes. We took a mechanical engineering quiz and and a safety quiz. To study for the mechanical engineering quiz, we did a worksheet <br>reviewing the mechanical engineering slides and writing notes from a video we watched on mechanical engineering. Our tinkercads for our rube goldberg projects were due on Tuesday, so we finished that and turned it in. <br>On Friday, we started to actually build our rube goldberg project, and we finished the beginning ramp for the baseball to roll on.

            9/11/23 - 9/14/23 Week 4 <br> This week we spent the majority of our time building our ruth goldberg project. For our project, we had 3 simple devices. A lever, an inclined plane, and <br>a wheel and axle. The way it worked is the ball rolls onto the lever, which pushes the needle attatched to a car onto a ramp, leading it to pop the balloon. It was challenging converting and building what we modeled in <br>tinkercad to real life. However, over time we found ways to overcome these challenges and pop the balloon successfully.

            9/17/23 - 9/21/23 Week 5 <br> On Monday, we spent the day editing our websites and troubleshooting. On tuesday, we did 2 challenges. One of them was a boat challenge, and I made the misake<br> of adding too little weight. My boat oculd have easily handled more weight, but I was scared of it sinking. The other challenge we did was making a paper E. I got a 6/10, because I forgot to match the total vertical<br> length of the E to the total length of the E on the right. On thursday, we finished the paper E challenge, and learned about computer engineering. We have a test next week, so I need to start preparing soon.

            9/25/23 - 9/28/23 Week 6 <br> This week was all about computer engineering. On monday, we did a worksheet about computer engineering, taking notes from a video and 2 slideshows. Then, on <br>Tuesday, we did a lab dissecting a computer to see its parts. it was very interesting seeing the inside of a computer and seeing what the components can do. On Thursday, we did a computer architecture coloring worksheet,<br> testing our knowledge of computer parts. We also took a computer engineering test. I was kind of unprepared, but luckily we had time to study in class and I ended up with a 12/13. Overall, the hardest part about this week was taking apart and putting back together the computer.

            10/2/23 - 10/5/23 Week 7 <br> This week was all about bioengineering. We built and designed prosthetics to get a grasp of what bioengineers do on a daily basis. I found bioengineering to <br>be pretty interesting. Building and designing prosthetics is a lot harder than it looks when you factor in things like the material that it needs to be made of, how everything needs to work, etc. Making a limb that is <br>multipurpose is a challenge. However, the proesthetic we needed to build only needed to fulfill one task, and that was to pick up a water bottle. For the animal prosthetic, I designed a bat wing.

                10/9/23 - 10/12/23 Week 8 <br> Since this week was shorter, we had less time to do things. On Monday, we learned about aerospace engineering. It was interesting learning about forces like <br>lift, drag, thrust, and weight, and how they affect how something travels. It was a little confusing at first, but once I undestood it I found it very interesting. The videos were also interesting, because I got to see<br> how the things I learned applied to real life. On Thursday, we designed our bottle rockets on tinkercad. Honestly, I think I could improve on my design, but I can't think of anything else to add. Currently, I have a cone on top of the rocket and 4 fins on the sides of the rocket to give it a more aerodynamic shape.

                10/16/23 - 10/19/23 Week 9 <br> This week, we designed, built, and tested our rockets. Our rocket had a design with a cone and 4 fins on the side, so it was a pretty basic design. I saw at <br>least 15 rockets that had the same exact design as ours. However, our rocket went the furthrest out of everyones. This is because we chose to use 85 PSI and use a 1 and 1/8 cups of water. This caused our rocket to go <br>extremely fast and go the furthest. Most of our speed and potential distance was lost, because it started spinning, but we still went the farthest nonetheless. If I could change one thing, I would increase the pressure and the amount of water to make it go farther and faster.

                10/23/23 - 10/27/23 Week 10 <br> This week, we learned about environmental engineering. Me and my partner made a filter out of various materials. Our order for the filter was rocks, pebbles, <br>sand, then cotton balls. Our filter worked fine for the first few minutes, but then it got jammed, and almost no watter was coming out the other end of it. Our water ended up looking clean except for the fact that it<br> was yellow, and there wasn't that much water because our filter was clogged. If I could do it again, I would take apart all the pieces of the filter to see what was causing issues, then clean it and fix it accordingly. I found out that I had no idea that water treatment was this complicated, and I took clean water for granted.

                10/30/23 - 11/3/23 Week 11 <br> This week, we learned about electrical engineering. Honestly, I think this has been the most challenging week of this class. I learned a lot about electrical <br>engineering, but I also learned that I don't understand a lot of it either. I learned the equation V=IR to calculate resistance, voltage, or current. I also learned what resistance, current, and voltage is. However, I <br>still don't really understand how a circuit works. I understand the basic idea, but I can't apply it in tinkercad; I find it very challenging. The hardest was lab two: parallel for me. With the help of my groupmates I completed it, but I still don't fully understand it.

                11/6/23  - 11/8/23 Week 12 <br> This week, we did more electrical engineering. First, we transferred our tinkercads onto actual breadboards to do labs 3 and 4. These labs have been some of the <br>the most fun and most frustrating labs by far. It was super fun building a circuit and having everything work, and it made me want to experiement more on what I could do. Seeing what I learned on paper and applying it<br> and seeing it actually work was very satisfying and fun to me. However, the arduino portion of the lab was frustrating. My code wouldn't change the pattern of the LEDs, and so it was stuck to the same pattern, making me unable to do the lab. I probably spent the almost the entire period trying to figure it out until I gave up, <br>and then found out later that we needed to download an app to make it work.

                11/13/23 - 11/16/23 Week 13 <br> This week we learned about business engineering. Honestly, business engineering isn't something that i'm interested in currently, but maybe I might be interested <br>in it in the future. Business engineering is a hybrid between technology and business administration, so you have to be good with talking to people. I am not good at talking to people at all, so I don't think I <br>would be a good fit for the job. Business engineering also requires you to be good with data, which doesn't interest me at all. I find statistics and data somewhat boring. For our sharktank brainstorming, we didn't really come up with anything. We had a few ideas that were kind of bad, like a license plate flipper and a charger that <br>follows you around.

                11/27/23 - 11/30/23 Week 14 <br> This week was probably the one of the most fun weeks in this class. We presented our sharktank pitches for business engineering, and all of them were pretty good. <br> A few of them were a little rough around the edges, but most of them were realistic and practical. Our idea was an airline that didn't allow anyone below the age of 18. Since kids are always crying and kicking<br> the back of people's seats, we thought it would be a good idea to have an airline that doesn't allow any kids at all. My favorite pitch was probably recrcles, which was a food item made for third world countries who can't afford food. They are made from food wastes, and as a result are extrememly cheap. I think this is a really good <br>idea, because it could help a lot of starving people in the world.

                                    Week 15 <br> 1. held What was the weight of your bridge? Our first bridge weighed 41.3 grams. Our second bridge weighed 28 grams. <br>2. What was the weight held by your bridge? Our first bridge held 772 grams. Our second bridge held 592 grams. <br>3. What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held? Our first bridge's ratio was 19. Our second bridge's ratio was 21. <br>4. What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed most to the weight? The heaviest part of our first bridge was the base. The heaviest part of the second bridge was the base and the glue supporting the supports. <br>5. Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research? We researched a truss bridge because our sources told us it was the strongest type of bridge. Our first bridge was the full truss bridge, and our second bridge was just the base of the truss bridge. <br>6. Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse? The design did not work as intended. We didn't double layer the noodles, making it flimsy and easy to break. Other than that we got the proportions and the design right for the most part on our first bridge. <br>7. What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected weakest point? The point of failure of our bridge was where we hung the buckets. This was expected, as where the buckets are hung is generally where there is the most strain on the bridge.

                1/8 - 1/12 S2 Week1 <br> This week was mostly catching up after our school wifi got hacked. However, on thursday, we did chemical engineering, which is not something I am particularly interested in, but the project was fun. If I had to choose a field of chemical engineering to major in, I would probably choose metallurgy, because it sounds the coolest. During our project, it was going well until someone from another group poured a lot of water into our oobleck. After that, it was too liquidy and we had to search for leftover cornstarch to balance it out. Hopefully we get to do more projects like these in the future.

                S2 Week 2 <br> This week was the proposal for the arduino car project that we are building. We weren't originally going to implement sensors in our car, but then when we found out that we could use them, we decided to, as most of the refrences we looked up online contained sensors. Even though I am not building a mousetrap car, the mousetrap car video was very interesting. Maybe because the video was made by Mark Rober, but I found it more interesting than most of the other videos I have watched. Our milestones for our proposal was making the code, and building the base of the car. I think these are good goals, because it gives us an idea of what to focus on.

                S2 Week 3 <br> This week was about building the arduino car and finalizing designs. For building our car, we started with the breadboard part of it and it was pretty complicated. There were a bunch of wires that we had to connect to the motors in a specific way, and we had trouble connecting the wheels to the breadboard. After we figure out the breadboard, we're going to figure out the coding part of it and try to make the wheels turn. Hopefully after that there will be no more issues with coding and we can move on to the building portion, but I highly doubt it, so we're going to put aside some time for technical difficulties as well. Our tinkercad is straightforward, so hopefully there won't be any measurement or design issues when we're building it. 
<img src="cararduino.jpeg" width="300px" height="180px">
                S2 Week 4 <br> This week we made the most progress we have ever made. At first, we hit a block because no one could figure out what was wrong with the coding. After the coding was figured out we had problems finding a wheel that worked. Almost all of the wheels had a lot of broken parts, so we needed to reattatch the metal. After that, we built the actual car by cutting a piece of cardboard and attatching a CD wheel to the back of the car. We're planning to attatch the arduino, breadboard and battery next week as well as make the car move. Hopefully it goes smoothly with no issues, but it probably will so it might take longer than expected.

                S2 Week 5 and Week 6 <br> This week we made a lot of progress as well. At first, our second wheel wouldn't work, and we were stuck on fixing that for a very long time. After a long time of troubleshooting, we finally figured out that it was a dead spot in the breadboard. After that, we built the entire arduino car, but we still haven't tested whether or not it works. We're planning to put in sensors in our car, but none of us have an android phone, so we might have to borrow someone's phone to implement that. For week 6, we just made some finishing touchces to our car. We also ran into a problem with our code for a little bit, trying to make the car turn. After we figured that out, we adjusted the wheels to make it turn straight, and added decorations to our car as well. Our car definitely doesn't look pretty, but the decorations made it easier to look at. We added a fake self destruct button with an LED, eyes, and piercings to make it look better. Hopefully the tests can go smoothly, and it works as planned. Our car also doesn't work if the chromebook isn't plugged in, so we have to walk next to it to make it work.

                S2 Week 7 <br> This week testing week. Our test went as well as we thought it would; the code worked as planned and nothing went wrong. Everything went as expected, as we planned and tested before the actual test. Our car didn't travel far, because we programmed it to go backwards and turn as well as go forwards. If I had more time, I would put a sensor in our car, and make it cleaner. In our tinkercad, we designed it to have a sensor to be able to see and avoid objects, and I wanted to stay true to the tinkercad. Also, our car had a lot of wires and metal sticking and poking out everywhere, so I would like to make it cleaner as well. 
                
                S2 Week 8 <br> We mainly used Mark Rober's video on egg drops to build the design of our eggdrop. We built it with calculations and proportions in mind, so even without the parachute or the balloons, it should work. The parachute and balloons add extra cushioning and safety to the eggdrop. We built the skeleton made out of straws so far, which is the majority of the build. Our plan for next week is to finalize the build and test it to make sure it works. I was on the doors side for the doors vs. wheels. Our argument had a concrete number and a defined definition, unlike the wheels side, so we won. We defined it as anything that spun on an axis to give access to something new.
